        <h1>Medicine Through Time</h1>
        <p>Medicine has evolved massively over time and there are many different factors which effected the development and hinderance of the evolution of medicine and surgery. From the belief that God used illness as a tested or punishment to the idea that smells brought upon a plague on humanity to what it is today. From the absence of science to it becoming the main reason for the advancement of medicine. From barbers cutting both your hair off and your legs to trained surgeons performing transplants.</p>
