        <h1>The Enlightenment</h1>
        <p id = "starter">The Enlightenment runs through the years 1700AD to 1900AD, subject to the Stuarts and the Hanoverians. </p>
        <h2><u>Causes of Illness</u></h2>
        <p>Before Louis Pasteur's work in 1861, there was a debate over how infections were spread, most scientists believed spontaneous generation (the idea that microbes would randomly spawn in the air and cause illness) and that diseases could be spread by miasma or contact. In 1857, Pasteur tried to explain why the sugar beet used to ferment alcohol soured. Pasteur thought that germs in the air were responsible. He found that sterilised water was still sterile if the flask was closed, but was not sterile if the flask was open. This suggested that there were germs in the air. In 1861, he published his theory - germs were causing infections (Germ Theory). Microscopes (invented in the 17th century) eventually allowed Pasteur to see the micro-organisms that he described. </p>
        <p>Pasteur faced serious opposition for his theory. A famous doctor called Charlton Bastian supported the theory of spontaneous generation, which contradicted Pasteur's Germ Theory. Pasteurs's research focused on how liquids, such as milk went sour (pasteurisation). Many did not see the connection to humans. Doctors did not believe that small germs could cause such harm to humans. </p>
        <p>People gradually began to believe (and treat people in accordance with) Germ Theory. Germ Theory proved that disease was not spread by miasma, spontaneous generation, and an imbalance in the Four Humours was not the cause of illness. Germ Theory was the correct cause of illness so medical treatments became much safer and technological developments meant that disease could be identified and stopped more effectively.</p>
        <p>Robert Koch showed that germs were not all the same. He identified the different microbes that caused anthrax in 1876, septicaemia in 1878, tuberculosis in 1882 and cholera in 1883 by injecting animals with diseases. He then dyed bacteria and viewed them using microscopes. Other scientists then discovered typhus in 1880, pneumonia in 1880, tetanus in 1884, diphtheria in 1884 and the plague in 1890. William Cheyne translated Koch's work and highlighted that not all microbes caused harmful disease.</p>
        <p>Pasteur and Koch tried to apply Germ Theory to develop more advanced vaccinations. In 1879, Pasteur accidentally showed that vaccinations could prevent disease. In 1881, Pasteur produced a weakened vaccine for anthrax in sheep. By 1884, Pasteur created a vaccine for rabies. A year laer this was applied to human subjects. </p>
        <br>
        <h2><u>Treatments of Illness</u></h2>
        <p>Before the 19th century, people often avoided surgery because it was so painful. Anaesthetics could be used but they were dangerous. This meant that most surgery was quick to try to minimise pain. Complex surgery would be too painful. In 1800, physicians and surgeons gave patients alcogol or gave them opium to numb the pain. Humphrey Davy was the first to use nitrous oxide (laughing gas) to stop patients from feeling pain. Horace Wells then used it in 1844 to numb the pain in dental surgery. Dr James Simpson first used Chloroform in surgery in 1847. It was effective but it led to death in high doses. It killed Hannah Greener in 1848. Queen Victoria used Chloroform in childbirth in 1853. Ether was first used by the American dentist William Clark in 1842 and then by Robert Liston for a leg amputation in 1846. Ether was effective but hard to inhale (it also led to vomiting) and was explosive. </p>
        <p>Anaethetics initially increased the number of deaths in surgery. People did more complex operations and hygiene was still bad in surgeries. Doing more complex surgery for longer in an unhygienic place increased the risk of infection and fatal blood loss. Some army surgeons thought that soldiers should endure the pain. Some religious people thought that the pain suffered during surgery was God's will. After Queen Victoria used anaesthetics in childbirth, anaethetics became more popular. Public demonstrations of the drugs also helped to make anaethetics more widely accepted. </p>
        <p>Anaethetics reduced the pain in surgery but infection still killed lots of people in surgery. Antiseptics were used to kill the microbes close to wounds in surgery. A British surgeon called Joseph Lister applied Pasteur's Germ Theory to surgery. He thought that germs explained why wounds from surgery got infected. Lister used carbolic acid as a chemical which could kill bacteria. This stopped germs from infecting wounds in surgery. The death rate in Lister's patients fell from 46% to 15%. Covering surgical instruments, bandages and surgeon's hands in carbolic acid reduced the change of infection. He tested his ideas on a boy called Jamie Greenlees's fracture and the wound was not infected. Lister published the results of Greenlees and ten other patient's surgery in 1867, proving Pasteur's Germ Theory.</p>
        <p>Lister was heavily criticised. Most doctors still believed that chemicals caused infections rather than germs. Pasteur's ideas were not yet accepted and people still believed in spontaneous generation. Carbolic acid was unpleasant for doctors to use because it irritated their lungs and skin. Many surgeons tried to copy Lister's methods but did not do it properly. This made them think that the theory was wrong. However, as a result of Lister's discovery, ten times more surgeries were performed in the UK in 1912 relative to 1867 because the chance of survival increased so much. </p>
        <p>Antiseptics tried to kill microbes on patient's wounds. Aseptic surgery tried to stop microbes and germs reaching the wounds in the first place. Aseptic surgery methods tried to completely eliminate bacteria before and during an operation, rather than trying to kill microbes on a specific wound. By 1880, Pasteur's Germ Theory was widely accepted by British doctors. By 1900, aseptic surgery had become very common. In aseptic surgery, surgeons were scrubbed clean, wore new clothes and thin rubber gloves. Surgeons used sterilised instruments and operating theatres got smaller to reduce the chance of infection. These developments were largely advanced by wars, such as the Crimean War. War provided test cases for surgeons to try out these new techniques. </p>

        <h2><u>Prevention of Illness</u></h2>
        <p>By 1900, British towns generally had good systems in place to deal with sewage and to provide clean water to their population. It was largely government intervention that led to these changes.</p>
        <p>The Public Health Act (1848) set up a Central Board of Health to improve public health. Towns were asked to set up their own Local Board of Health. Town councils were given the power to spend money on improving street cleanliness. The result of the act was mixed because councils had their own autonomy. Some cleaned their streets but some didn't. In 1854. the Central Board of Health was shut down as it was seen as a violation of the government's laissez-faire approach. However, in 1858, London was struck by the 'Great Stink'. The River Thames was so full of sewage and the weather was so hot that London smelt very bad. Parliament noticed the smell and this prompted them to improve London's hygiene and sewage systems. The 1848 act was voluntary, but the 1875 act was mandatory. It forced local authorities to: provide clean water, provide proper sewage systems, collect rubbish on the street, appoint a Medical Officer of Health.</p>
        <p>In 1867, more working class men won the right to vote (Second Reform Act), this shift in the voting population helped to improve living conditions across the UK.</p>
        <br>
        <h2><u>Changes for Physicians and Scientists</u></h2>
        <p>Surgeon's status began to improve towards the end of the Middle Ages and doctors' training also improved. The ideas of the four humours and miasmas remained common, but there was growing awareness that dirt and disease were connected.</p>
        <p>The College of Physicians was set up in 1518. Most British doctors were trained here and they were still learning Galen's works. In the 18th century, most doctors still believed in the four humours or that disease was spread through 'bad air' (miasmas). Doctors got a license if they were trained at the college of physicians. Quack doctors did not receive this license, but some unlicensed doctors were also good doctors.</p>
        <h2><u>Florence Nightingale and Mary Seacole</u></h2>
        <p>Florence Nightingale (born in 1820) helped nursing to become professional. Her work with 38 nurses (chosen by her) in the Crimean War in 1854 reduced death rates hugely because of her improvements in the hygiene of wards. Following the work of Nightingale, a higher level of cleanliness and organisation was demanded from hospitals. Hospitals began to create pharmacies which could provide medicine. When Nightingale got back from the war, she published a book "Notes on Nursing". The status of nursing was enhanced as they were expected to care for patients and assist doctors. The Nightingale School of Nursing was set up in St Thomas' Hospital in London. When Nightingale arrived at the battlefield, she was appalled by the conditions that the soldiers were living in. The soldiers were sleeping on the floor in their own blood and bodily fluids. Nightingale provided each soldier with beds and frequently changed their bed sheets to ensure comfort and clean environments for the soldiers. She made sure that the hospital was clean and the soldiers were comforted and cared for. Prior to this, nurses were not as involved in the care of the patients, doing the bare minimum. Nightingale also endorsed the pavillion style for hospitals where they would ensure good ventilation and airflow, clean rooms and wards, and an isolation ward for highly contagious patients.</p>
        <p>Mary Seacole was a black woman who also went to nurse in a hospital during the Crimean War, she even went directly onto the battlefield to treat the wounded. Seacole cleaned the hospital, provided clean beds and care to the soldiers, very much the same as Nightingale did. However, when she returned home to England, she was not received the same amount of praise and rewards that Nightingale did because she was a black woman.</p>
        <br>
        <h2><u>Case Study - Edward Jenner and Vaccination</u></h2>
        <p id = "starter">Until the late 1700s, disease spread easily and people did not know many ways to stop their spread. Edward Jenner was born in 1749 and he is famous for his role in vaccinating people against smallpox.</p>
        <h3>The Effect of Smallpox</h3>
        <p>In the 1700s, smallpox was one of the most fatal diseases in the world. Smallpox was very contagious and its symptoms were a fever, headache, rash, and blisters filled with pus. Thirty percent of people who got smallpox died. Those who survived were often blind or had very deep scars. </p>
        <h3>Inoculation</h3>
        <p>The existing way to treat smallpox was inoculation. It was first brought to Britain by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu who observed it in Turkey. Inoculation involved putting pus from a person with a mild form of smallpox into a cut in a healthy person's body. People believed this gave them resistance. Inoculation was popular in the 1700s with aristocrats. However, many people did not get inoculated for religious reasons. They thought that it interfered with God's wil. Also, the inoculation dose could also be too big and kill the patient. Unfortunately, people who had been inoculated could still pass smallpox onto other people. Worst of all, inoculation was a treatment that only rich people could afford.</p>
        <h3>Jenner's Work</h3>
        <p>Edward Jenner was a country doctor. He thought that the milkmaid did not get smallpox but did catch a milder disease called cowpox. He tested his theory and it seemed to be correct</p>
        <p>Jenner gave an eight year old boy, James Phipps, cowpox before injecting him with smallpox. James Phipps didn't catch smallpox. Jenner tested this on sixteen more patients and concluded that cowpox was an effective vaccination against smallpox. He published his research in 1798.</p>
        <h3>Religious Opposition</h3>
        <p>Some people in the Church thought that vaccination wasn't natural and should not be done. The level of opposition seen by the formation of the Anti-Compulsory Vaccination League in 1866. This was thirteen years after the vaccination was made compulsory.</p>
        <h3>Other Opposition</h3>
        <p>Publishing his discovery in 1798, Jenner faced serious opposition. He faced criticism because he could not explain why the vaccination worked. Many doctors did not wish to use the vaccination because they profited from the smallpox inoculation. Jenner was not part of the clique of fashionable doctors in London. For this reason, he was exluded from academic favour. Unfortunately, attempts to replicate the experiment failed, due to contaminated equipment, which cause people to believe that Jenner's theory was wrong. </p>
        <h3>Government Involvement</h3>
        <p>Despite all of this opposition, the vaccination came to be accepted. The vaccination was less dangerous than the traditional smallpox inoculation. Gaining the favour of the royal family helped sway popular opinion, parliament gave Jenner £10,000 to further his research in 1802. BY 1853, the vaccination was made compulsory under law. </p>
        <br>
        <h2><u>Case Study - John Snow and Cholera</u></h2>
        <p id = "starter">Cholera is a disease transmitted through water. At the time, people thought that it was produced by rubbish and human waste and was spread through the air (miasmas). Streets were cleaned but water was often not clean.</p>
        <h3>Living Conditions</h3>
        <p>The Industrial Revolution happened in Britain between 1760 and 1840. It saw lots of people move to cities and begin to work in manufacturing industries. Lots of people moved to the cities because that is where most manufacturing jobs were located. Thousands of people migrated from the countryside to cities such as London, Birmingham, and Machester. For the first time, more people lived in British cities than the countryside. </p>
        <p>Most people living in cities lived in terrible living conditions. Workers lived in very small houses which were very close together, and sometimes families lived in one small room of a building. Workers also received very low wages and they often lived in poverty. </p>
        <p>Private toilets were rare, most families used toilets outside the house which were shared with others. Sewage would fall into a cesspit, which was often washed away by rain or thrown in rivers. Water came from local rivers, which is where sewage from cesspits often went. This was sometimes a worse situation than Ancient Rome. The streets were also dirty with wastage and sewage. People's health may have been worse than any other time in history.</p>
        <p>Because of these poor conditions and overcrowding, disease was very common. Some of the worst diseases were typhoid, tuberculosis and cholera. Typhoid was caused by contaminated food or water, it was spread through unhygienic conditions. Tuberculosis was caused by germs spread through sneezing or coughing, it was spread through overcrowded areas. Cholera was caused by contaminated water or food. </p>
        <p>Local councils were usually responsible for these health problems. Some people thought government should intervene but often they did not. Local taxpayers made decisions and many of these did not want to pay more money to improve health conditions (for others) in their town.</p>
        <h3>The Epidemic</h3>
        <p>Cholera Epidemics affected Britain every few years between 1831 and 1866. Symptoms of cholera included vomiting and having painful diarrhoea. Although governments were converned about cholera epidemics, they did not know what caused cholera and, therefore, how to prevent it.</p>
        <h3>Edwin Chadwick - report</h3>
        <p>After the cholera epidemics, Edwin Chadwick wrote a report on living conditions for the working classes in 1842. It was called the "Report on the Sanitary Conditions of the Laboring Population". Chadwick thought that bad health was being caused by bad air and damp. People were shocked by how bad living conditions were for the poor. Chadwick recommended that laws should improve drainage and sewage systems. He thought medical officers should be appointed to improve the situation for the poor. Although the explanation for disease was incorrect, Chadwick recognised the need to improve public hygiene, particularly the need for clean water and streets. </p>
        <p>Chadwick stressed that improving public health (by raising taxes) would benefit Britain as the workforce would work harder and make more goods. The governments 'laissez-faire' policy meant they did not take action following Chadwick's report. They believed that the goverment should not interfere in the poor's lives. Some towns like Manchester and Liverpool did improve their sewage and water systems.</p>
        <h3>John Snow's Work</h3>
        <p>Dr John Snow (born in 1813) was a physician who examined the link between cholera and contaminated water after an outbreak of cholera in London in 1854.</p>
        <p>Dr Snow saw that all the victims of the cholera epidemic in 1854 lived near the Broad Street water pump. He removed the pump's handle and forced everyone to use another pump. This stopped the spread of the disease in the area. Snow discovered that the pump's water had been contaminated by a leaking street toilet. This confirmed that cholera was not airborne but waterborne. </p>
        <p>William Farr collected medical statistics that recorded how people died. Dr Snow used Farr's statistics to see whether there was a link between water contaminated with sewage and deaths from cholera. His statistics showed that deaths from Cholera seemed to be linked to specific water sources. These statistics were very important to prove Dr Snow's hypothesis.</p>
        <p>However, Snow faced major opposition as he couldn't prove why cholera was waterborne. He only knew the fact that it was associated with contaminated water but not the scientific reason for why.</p>
