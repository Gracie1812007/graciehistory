        <h2><u>Causes of Illness</u></h2>
        <p>During the Middle Ages, the Church had the majority of control of the people in the country, having massive influence over society. The main cause of illness at the time was God. People believed that God would send illness as a punishment for their sins or a test of faith. Other beliefs for the cause of illness was also miasma, which is the belief that bad smells in the air caused illness. Causes for illness also included things such as astrology, which was believing that the placement and movement of the stars and planets were the causes of illness. However, there is one other belief which is not associated with the supernatural or religion, this is the Theory of the Four Humours. A theory created by Hippocrates, a greek philosopher and scientist. The theory states that the body is made up of four humours (black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood) which when out of balance would cause the body to develop illness. People also believed that Jews were poisoning the waters, causing illness, as well as the believing that witches and spirits were cursing the people of their towns, bringing about plagues and death.</p>
        <br>
        <h2><u>Treatments of Illness</u></h2>
        <p>Treatment of illness was massively diverse depending on who it was coming from as well as the fact that the majority of the time it would not work as the cause of illness was still unknown or believed to be something it was not. Many people were not trained officially in medicine, most learned it by word-of-mouth rather than official training. They experimented with herbal remedies, charms, and learned from apothecaries, travelling healers and wise men/women. Apothecaries were people who would mix herbal remedies and sell them to people in need but these treatments could not always be trusted as they also mixed poisons. Barber surgeons were, as they sound, barbers who would perform small surgeries such as setting broken bones, amputations, and even removing cateracts. However, many people died when going to barber surgeons as their wounds would get infected easily due to the unsanitary environment. Blood letting was a major treatment that would be performed by barber surgeons, this is where people would use leaches to help release blood from the patient, they did this to when they believed that someone has too much of the blood humour and they were trying to rebalance the humours (usually done with leeches). Cupping was also a form of blood letting where they would heat up a cup which would cause pressure, sucking out the blood.</p>
        <p>The closest thing to a doctor were those who were trained in Hippocratic and Galenic methods. This would include people who went to universities for this training, usually lasting 7 years. Galen was a roman philosopher who specialised in the science of medicine. Due to the restriction on dissection of human bodies, Galen was forced to only dissect animals, limiting himself to defining the human anatomy incorrectly such as that the jaw was made of two bones rather than one. However, universities were often set up by the Church, meaning they had complete control over what was and wasn't taught to the doctors. The Church would censor any information which did not follow their beliefs, preventing any progress in medicine until the printing press was invented. Doctors were taught to use the Regimen Sanitatis for treatment of patients as well as preventions of illness. This was a set of instructions for the patients to use which included details on hygiene and anything that they recommended should be done. However, the main issues with these doctors was that they were very expensive to seek out so the poor did not have access to their treatments. The poor could only seek treatment in hospitals run by monasteries. However, these places would be more focuses on the care of the sick rather than treatment as their main source of treatment were religious solutions such as prayers or religious objects. The churches would also deny anyone who was terminally ill or pregnant as they did not want the church to become associated with death and many women would die in child birth due to the lack of care and increased risk of infection after birth. These people would often turn to the apothecaries and women at home. The women at home would learn herbal treatments and other remedies from their own mothers passed on through generations.</p>
        <p>Surgery was highly dangerous in the Middle Ages for many different reasons. Firstly, infections in even the smallest forms was highly dangerous as antibiotics had not yet been invented so getting an infection meant either the body was to fight it off alone or the infected areas had to be amputated and/or cauterised. Second, pain was a big issue during surgery as anaethetic also had not yet been invented and they had to use natural sources to numb pain which would have included things such as hemlock or opium, these both being deadly in high does, often killing the patient. And finally, blood loss would cause many issues in surgery as there was no blood transfusions and major surgeries would have to be performed quickly or the patient would die from it. Common surgical practices included blood letting, amputation, trepanning (drilling a hole in the skull, often used when a patient is behaving abnormally), cauterisation (burning a wound to stop blood flow) and purging (this was either eating more food and drinking more or not eating or drinking anything to remove any toxins from the system or rebalancing the humours).</p>
        <br>
        <h2><u>Prevention of Illness</u></h2>
        <p>There was very minimal prevention of illness in the Middle Ages which included both physical and supernatural methods. Supernatural methods included living a life without sin, sinning was believed to bring illnes. Prayer and charms were also massively used to prevent illness, never working. People were recommended to keep good smells around such as flowers to prevent bad smells in the home, due to miasma. Hygiene was also a large part of the prevention of illness which was a good prevention of illness. The people were recommended to wash frequently and wear clean clothes to prevent illness. Diet was also a prevention of illness as they believed that eating too much or too little would imbalance the humours and cause illness.</p>

        <h2><u>Case Study - The Black Death</u></h2>
        <p id = "starter">The Black Death was an epidemic which hit England in 1348. The disease was a mixture of bubonic plague (spread by fleas on rats) and pneumonic plague (airbourne spread by coughing/sneezing). The infected would die within two days of the first symptoms.</p>
        <h3>Life before and during the Black Death</h3>
        <p>Public health conditions in major cities were very poor, contributing to the easy spread of disease. The Thames became so dirty that the new pipes had to be built to prevent the water supply from becoming so contaminated and people were encouraged to clean the streets of dirt and sewage. Rivers were both used for sewage and drinking water so there was a lack of clean water, spreading water-born diseases such as cholera. These unsanitary conditions were heavily affected by the massive population growth and urbanisation, the poor being unable to have decent housing meant that they were sharing homes with multiple families without any way of cleaning them. Due to misunderstanding, many of the issues were also caused by the poor cleanliness of the towns as people did not understand that dirty conditions would cause disease, this reinforced the idea of miasma as the bad smells were caused by the poor conditions. </p>
        <h3>Cause of the Black Death</h3>
        <p>The disease began in Asia and spread to Europe on the rats that hid on merchant ships. At the time, people thought that the epidemic was caused by supernatural things like the position of the stars (or God's wrath) or natural reasons such as miasma or humour imbalances. Due to living conditions, the fleas from the rats would spread to humans quickly.</p>
        <h3>Remedies</h3>
        <p>Many used prayers to satisfy God, some tried to use herbs to keep them safe from miasma. Others tried purging, vomiting, and blood letting to keep humours in balance. Others tried to move away or avoid those who had become infected. Anyone travelling to new towns would be quarantined for 40 days to prevent the spread, but the infected were not. Many people thought that the plague was caught from dead bodies so many towns tried to build more cemeteries and others began mass burning the bodies. Other towns also attempted to prevent anyone new entering the towns, to prevent the spread. However, this did not usually work. </p>
        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <p>The plague not only killed huge amounts of the population but it also led to food shortages (and higher food prices because of this), making life even more difficult for the people who survived the Black Death. An estimated thirty to forty percent of the British population died from the Black Death and the Church experience some of this devasation with a lot of experienced priests dead. A large number of peasants were killed by the plague so survivors asked for higher wages and moved around to find them. Although, the large death toll cause the cost of land to fall, leading to more peasants to having the means to buy their own land. The worst of the Black Death ended in 1350 but plagues continued for centuries, the worst example including the Great Plague of 1665. </p>
