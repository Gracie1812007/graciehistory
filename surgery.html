        <h1>Surgery in WW1</h1>
        <p id = "starter">World War 1 began in 1914 and ended in 1918. Even thought the war was a tragedy for human life on either side of the battle, it resulted in many different surgical and medical advancements.</p>
        <h2><u>Context</u></h2>
        <p>Most of the fighting on the Western Front was carried out from trencehs. Usually, trenches were dug below ground, with the upper level just above the surface, protected by hundreds of sandbags. However, in wet areas, trenches were built using 'breastworks' (sandbags full of clay). Most trenches were six feet deep. Deeper trenches gave more protection but they too longer and were much harder to dig, and there was the issue of how long it would take to escape in the event of a direct attack. The trenches were dug in three straight, parallel lines, each line having its own function. The front line contained the 'fire trench' - which faced the enemy and was where most of the combat happened- and the supervision trench - which was used to move around behind the firing line, transmitting orders, messages, and supplies. Behind the front line, the support trench, ideally 100m behind, and the reserve trenches - where soldiers could shelter and rest, moving to the front line when needed. Trenches were built in zigzag lines in order to minimise damage in the event of shelling or attack, making it harder for the enemy to navigate.</p>
        <h2><u>Support</u></h2>
        <p id = "starter">Trench warefare on the Western Front damaged terrain and disrupted transport networks, making it hard for supplies to reach the front line and the wounded to be evacuated. The Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) and First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY) were important medical units for the Allied Armies. </p>
        <h3>RAMC</h3>
        <p>The RAMC field ambulances set up mobile medical stations. Stretcher bearers would transport the wounded through relay posts until they eventually reached either a medical post or a transport link. </p>
        <p>The 'chain of evacuation' system aimed to move casualties with the highest chance of surviving to medical areas as quickly and as safely as possible. First aid was given close to the front line at Regimental Aid Posts (RAPs). Dressing stations collected men from the RAPs. Casualty clearing stations collected very seriously injured men from the dressing stations. Men could be given surgery in these buildings/tents between the front line and the base camp. Base hospitals were usually in real buildings. These were effectively turned into normal hospitals, far away from the battlefield. </p>
        <h3>FANY</h3>
        <p>The women of the FANY worked as 'field ambulances', a bit like paramedics in non-wartime societies. They would move wounded soldiers between the 'chain of evacuation'. They ran ambulance bus services called 'convoys' transporting people back to boats or trains which could get seriously injured soldiers away from the battlefield. </p>
        <h2><u>Plastic Surgery</u></h2>
        <p>The development of plastic srgery was motivated by the First World War. A doctor called Harold Gillies set up a unit to transplant skin for soldiers with facial wounds. IN 1917, Queen's hospital in Sidcup, Kent was established to treat soldiers with facial wonds. By the Second World War, Archibald McIndoe was using drugs such as penicilin to treat soldiers with facial wounds. Many of the new weaponry was dangerous for soldiers who were facing it. Explosives would scatter dangerous shrapnel which could tear the muscles apart, including the face. </p>
        <h2><u>Blood Transfusions</u></h2>
        <p>Blood transfusions often failed because scientists didn't know that different people had different blood types. Infections could be passed on through blood transfusions. Between 1900 and 1901, Karl Landsteiner discovered different blood types. He categorised these into type A, type B, type AB, and type O. Blood transfusions had to be matched to a patient's blood type to work.</p>
        <p>In 1914, Albert Hustin discovered how to store blood for long periods without clotting (using sodium citrate). This was needed for blood to reach the battlefield as prior to this, the donor had to be in the room connected to the patient. In 1938, the British National Blood Transfusion Service was opened. Prompted by the Second World War, the British and US developed large blood banks to treat wounded soldiers. </p>
        <h2><u>X-rays</u></h2>
        <p>In 1895, Wilhelm Rontgen discovered x-rays. Before the First World War x-rays were used to help doctor identify broken bones and disease. By 1901, radiotherapy was used to treat cancer. </p>
        <p>During the First World War, x-rays were used on the battlefield. Marie Curie developed mobile x-ray machines which were transportable. This allowed surgeons to identify where shrapnel or bullets were in a wounded soldier on the front line. </p>
        <h2><u>Disease in the Trenches</u></h2>
        <p id = "starter">The trenches were often mudbaths. Living in these conditions can spread disease, but soldiers also had to deal with shell attacks, gunshot wounds, gas attacks, and the emotional trauma of watching their comrades die. </p>
        <h3>Illness</h3>
        <p>Soldiers lived in cold and mud for up to four years. They were exposed to fungus, bacteria, and viruses spread quickly. Trench foot was discovered by Napolean's army in 1812. It happens if your feet are too wet and cold for too long. Lots of soldiers had their feet amputated because of the trench foot after experiencing gangrene. Suppy lines were often broken, meaning it was hard to clean drinking water. In battle, you may have to go to the bathroom in trenches. Unclean drinking water and living amongst faeces and urine spread disease. One way of preventing gangrene was using whale oil on the soldiers' feet and frequently changing their socks. </p>
        <h3>Gas Attacks</h3>
        <p>Tear gas (also called lachrimatory gas), mustard gas, phosgene and chlorine das were all gases used in World War One. They would inflame the throat and lungs when they were breathed in and Mustard gas and Chlorine gas could kill soldiers. The Geneva Protocol of 1925 outlawed gas attacks in wars. 90,000 people died in World War One from gas attacks (mostly Russian because lots of Russian soldiers weren't given gas masks).</p>
        <h3>Emotional Trauma</h3>
        <p>Shell shock is a psychological illness caused by having to sit through constant artiller bombardment. This often caused soldiers to break down psychologically. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is another illness that can be caused by exposure to wars. Many of the soldiers had to hide their trauma as mental health was not taken as seriously then as it is now. Few who admitted their struggles were sent to base hospitals or home for treatment but others were killed for treason or cowardice. </p>
        <h3>Infection</h3>
        <p>Wounds were usually gunshot wounds or from the shrapnl. Shells were filled with bullets and ball bearings which would explode outwards when a shell exploded. Bullets and shrapnel could cut deeply into soldier's flesh, this exposed soldiers' insides to the bacteria, urine, and faeces in the trenches. Wounds often got infected because they couldn't be cleaned quickly. This often caused sepsis, which is the fatal condition, which was common in medieval surgery. </p>
        <p>As Joseph Lister had suggested, wounds were washed using anti-septics. However, often this would be too late if a soldier could not be evacuated quickly. Carbolic acid would be used as an anti-septic in World War One. If a soldier had a badly infected wound, amputation could help to save the soldiers' life but would cripple them forever. </p>
        <h3>Animals</h3>
        <p>Infections and illness in the trenches could be spread by human contact, but also by animals like rats and fleas. They spread things like typhus among soldiers. Delousing stations had to be set up to remove the lice from soldiers, which had become a massive problem. </p>
        <h2><u>The Thomas Splint</u></h2>
        <p>Designed by Hugh Owen Thomas, the Thomas Splint saved thousands of mens' lives during World War One. The splint fixed a broken femur (thigh) in place whilst the person was being moved. This helped to reduce blood loss. The Thomas Splint reduced the number of fatalities caused by femur fractures in the trenches from 80% to 20%.</p>
