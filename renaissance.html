        <h1>The Renaissance</h1>
        <p id = "starter">The Renaissance runs through the years 1500AD to 1700AD, subject to the Tudors and the Stuarts. The influence of the Church was decreasing and the advancement of science began.</p>
        <h2><u>Context</u></h2>
        <p>At the end of the Middle Ages, the printing press was invented in 1436 by Johannes Gutenberg. This had a massive impact on the influence that the church had. Prior to the invention, monks would copy texts by hand, meaning that the church would decide what was written and what wasn't, preventing scientists from publishing their work if they did not follow the beliefs of the Church. Because of the printing press, scientists were able to begin publishing their work without censorship from the Church. This meant that science was able to advance medicine in ways it never could with the Church in control.</p>
        <p>The Church also lost massive influence over the country during Henry VIII's reign. Henry VIII separated from the Catholic Church and became an independent country from them. Because of this, Henry has sole discretion over how the religion was in the country, being head of the Church of England. Religion experienced major changes because of this. Henry closed down all monasteries in the country for the money that they held, this had major impacts on the treatment and care of the sick as monasteries were used as hospitals. The closure left as little as five hospitals running in Britain, majorly affected illness. </p>
        <p>Rediscovery of Hippocrates and Galen's work meant that people realised the importance of  dissection and the human anatomy. Human dissection was allowed which meant that accurate analysis of the human body was possible.</p>
        <p>New weapons and injuries also had major influence over medicine. Guns become more commonly used so doctors had to find new ways to deal with gunshot wounds.</p>
        <h2><u>Causes of Illness</u></h2>
        <p>During the Renaissance, there was a higher focus on the human and physical factors of medicine rather than the supernatural. After the Black Death, a lot of causes of illness were being questioned. The Theory of the Four Humours was disproved by the plague but doctors and physicians still used it due to refusal for change. Miasma became the main idea for cause of disease, astrology hardly being used. No new theories were developed during the renaissance, however.</p>
        <br>
        <h2><u>Treatment of Illness</u></h2>
        <p>Doctors in the Renaissance still didn't have much training. They still used old methods that people like Harvey thought were ineffective but some began to use more modern techniques. The printing press and the works of Harvey, Pare, Vesalius, and Sydenham helped to spread new ideas. However, blood transfusions only offered a solution to treat patients using Harvey's theory of circulation in 1628.</p>
        <p>However, religion was still quite influencial in Europe. Doctors still believed that supernatural things caused illness. Pilgrimages and prayers were still prescrived to cure illnesses. The people believed the 'Royal Touch' could cure diseases. People still sought wise women and apothecaries to cure disease. </p>
        <p>Hospitals began to focus on treating patients, not just caring for them. Hospitals would receive money from wealthy donors or royal endowments, so they could provide care for people who could not afford a physician. Books were being published which covered how to treat illness at home. However, Quakery was a form of medicine based on spectacles and display which many people viewed as fraudulent medicine and this became more common in the seventeenth and eighteenth century. Quacks often gave patients depressants like opium, which gave the impression that they were getting better. In reality, they were giving their patients an addiction. Workhouses became a source of treatment for the poor but there conditions were poor.</p>
        <p>New treatments such as transference was used, this is where they were try to transfer illnesses to animals such as chickens. Apothecaries were now officially trained as an apprentice for several years.</p>
        <br>
        <h2><u>Prevention of Illness</u></h2>
        <p>Prevention of illness did not change much during the Renaissance as there were no new ideas of the cause of disease. Many preventions stayed the same.</p>
        <br>
        <h2><u>Thomas Sydenham</u></h2>
        <p>Thomas Sydenham was born in 1624. He was a British physician who advanced the use of the scientific process in medicine. His records were a first stage to the statistics kept by William Farr over 100 years later. Sydenham prioritised treating patients based on all of their symptoms, not individually and observing the outcomes rather than learning from books. He recorded his observations of patients' illnesses and treatments and this allowed him to see patterns between illnesses and treatments. Sydenham used his records and the patterns he spotted to classify diseases into different types, similar to the classification of animals, based on which symptoms a patient had. For example, Sydenham showed that measles and scarlet fever were different types of diseases. In 1676, he published a book named "Medical Obeservations". Medical Observations were used by doctors for centuries. He described different illnesses and suggested ways to treat them. </p>
        <br>
        <h2><u>Andreas Vesalius</u></h2>
        <p>Vesalius was born in 1514 in Brussels, Belgium and worked at the University of Padua, Italy. Vesalius specialised in anatomy and his later work made it possible for further discoveries and future advances in medicine to take place. At the University, he was able to closely study the human body using dissection, giving him the opportunity to explore how the body worked and understand the roles of the different organs. Vesalius was best known for his book "On the Fabric of the Human Body", this was an extremely detailed and accurate guide for doctors on how the human body worked. It contained detailed and accurate drawings of the human body. Many of Vesalius' discoveries proved that Galen had some mistakes. For example, Vesalius proved that the human jaw bone was made of one bone, not two. He also proved that blood did not pass from one side of the heart to the other through the septum - a rubber-like tissue often referred to as cartilage. This encouraged other doctors to question other theories and ideas Galen had produced, sparking change in science and medicine.  </p>
        <br>
        <h2><u>The Royal Society</u></h2>
        <p>The Royal Society was created with the support of King Charles II in November 1660. It is an institution whose job was to promote and support scientific research. The Royal Society's journal was called "Philosophical Transactions", holding new ideas and theories released by the scientists who were apart of the Royal Society. The journal was well-respected and helped to spread scientific and medical ideas across Britain.</p>
        <h2><u>Case Study - William Harvey</u></h2>
        <p id = "starter">William Harvey was an English physician who was born in 1578. He studied medicine in Padua and was particularly interested in physiology. He was the physician for the English Kings James I and Charles I. Harvey challenged Galen's understanding of blood and how it circulated the body. He thought that blood circulated around the body. This view was different from Galen's view that new blood was made in the liver and used as fuel.</p>
        <p>Harvey used valves to show that blood could only flow one way in the body and he thought that too much blood was in the body to be continually created as fuel. He showed that the heart was a pump for the blood in the body.</p>
        <p>When Harvey first published his theory, he was ridiculed. Professional opinion did change, but it took a lot of time and lots of doctors continued to use bloodlettings despite Harvey showing it would not be effective. This highlights the limited impact of one individual. Although, Harvey made this major discovery, his ideas needed to be accepted by the medical community. Harvey's theory implied that bloodletting was a counterproductive method of treatment, but this continued for many years as doctors didn't know what else to do. Despite his discoveries, Harvey did not understand why blood needed to circulate around the body and why the blood in arteries and veins was differet. His theory of circulation was the first stage towards blood transfusions becoming possible to save people's lives. In 1661, after Harvey had died, a microscope was developed. This microscope showed that veins and arteries were linked by capillaries.</p>

        <h2><u>Case Study - The Great Plague</u></h2>
        <p id = "starter">In 1665, the bubonic plague reappeared in Britain. The epidemuc killed 100,000 people (almost 25% of London's population).</p>
        <h3>Believed Causes</h3>
        <p>People still blamed miasma or supernatural/religious causes (God's will) just like they did in the Black Death. However, the Four Humours was even more heavily disproved by this and people also began to believe that cats and dogs were the cause of the epidemic. People recognised the connection between dirt and disease so hygiene was prioritised more. Quarantines changed so that anyone infected by the illness were locked in their houses to stop the spread of disease. </p>
        <h3>Remedies</h3>
        <p>Remedies for the plague included bloodletting through leeches, smoking, using animals such as frogs or snakes to 'draw out the poison' or moving to the countryside. In 1666, the plague seemed to be ending. Some people think that the Great Fire of London (1666) killed a lot of the bacteria causing the plague and helping to end the pandemic. Plague doctors wore special suits to protect them against "miasma". They had masks stuffed with aromatic herbs to stop the "bad air" from reaching them. This was not based on correct science but luckily the suits probably helped to reduce the spread of the plague. Local governments and specia suits helped to deal with the plague better, but nobody really understood why it had happened or what caused it.</p>
