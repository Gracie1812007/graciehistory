        <h1>The Modern Period</h1>
        <p id = "starter">The Modern Period runs through the years 1900 to present day, subject to the Hanoverians and the Windsors.</p>
        <h2>Why was there Progress in 20th Century Medicine?</h2>
        <p>The 20th Century brought improvements in living conditions, transplants, blood transfusions, penicilin, plastic surgery, radiotherapy, and many new vaccinations. Medical progress was far higher than any century before it. This was because of a lot of factors.</p>
        <h3>Communication and Knowledge</h3>
        <p>Revolutionary ideas can diffuse slowly. Fleming's discovery was not recognised for many years. However, the printing press allowed his publications to be read more widely and they reached Florey and Chain. Inoculation was first brought to the UK by Lady Montagu who observed it in Turkey. Discoveries from France and Germany spread faster because of improvements in communication. </p>
        <h3>Government</h3>
        <p>The US government funded the initial mass production of penicilin in World War 2, ensuring that the soldiers had access to it. The improvements of living standards in the UK only really came from government action. Mandatory reforms in the form of the 1875 Second Public Health Act and the Welfare State seem to have had the largest impact on living conditions.</p>
        <h3>War</h3>
        <p>Florey and Chain received funding to mass produce penicilin partly because of World War Two. The World Wars meant that a lot of people needed plastic surgery and prosthetic limbs. Blood transfusions were needed on the battlefield. The Boer War made parliament realise that a malnourished population was not in their interests. </p>
        <h3>Individuals and Scientific Approach</h3>
        <p>Individuals like Louis Pasteur, Robert Koch, Alexander Flemming, Sir William Beveridge and Seebohm Rowntree all had impacts on society larger than you would expect from one individual. Science involves the objective observation of outcomes, but it also requires building upon the knowledge of previous scientists. Blood tranfusions needed an understanding of blood groups, which relied on the discoveries of William Harvey around circulation.</p>
        <h3>Chance</h3>
        <p>Fleming discovered penicilin because he left bacteria out in his laboratory. Lots of people only discovered the unhealthy state of British children because of the evacuation in the war. The Liberal Party was influenced by the launch of the Labour Party in 1900 as it pushed through its reforms at the start of the 20th century.</p>
        <br>
        <h2><u>Cause of Illness</u></h2>
        <p>After the Enlightenment, the true cause of disease was discovered, which meant that medicine could rapidly advance going forwards in all areas, including the discovery of new causes of diseases.</p>
        <p>Viruses are pathogens. They are not bacteria and could not be seen under microscopes by people like Koch and Pasteur. In 1892, Dmitry Ivanovsky stumbled upon the tobacco mosaic virus in plants. He found that some microbes stayed even after all bacteria microbes were killed. Martinus Beijernick was the first to call these microbes 'viruses' in 1898.</p>
        <p>The twentieth century was shaped by huge advancements in medicine. There were a number of developments in understanding the body and disease. In 1953, Leroy Stevens discovered stem cells. In 2013, the first human liver was grown only using stem cells. In 1953, Francis Crick and James Watson from the University of Cambridge mapped out DNA structure. This allowed developments in gene therapy, genetic screening and genetic engineering. In the 1990s, the Human Genome Project was launched, this was designed to identify all 40,000 genes in the human body.</p>
        <p>From 1946 to 1969, free vaccines were made available in the UK. These were for diseases such as tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, polio, measles, and rubella.</p>
        <p>Today, lots of illnesses are created by people themselves. Smoking cigarettes can cause cancer. Eating too much unhealthy food can lead to obesity, which is linked to type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol can lead to cirrhosis of the liver. </p>
        <br>
        <h2><u>Treatment of Illness</u></h2>
        <p>Viruses could not be killed by antibiotics. This meant that a new treatment had to be found and they were approved for use on people. Antiviral drugs can stop viruses from growing in the body, but they were not discovered until a lot later in the 1950s. Antibiotics kill bacteria, but antivirals only stop viruses from growing, they don't kill them. The body (and its immune system) must kill the virus.</p>
        <p>In 1973, Geoffrey Hounsfield created CAT scanners, which could produce 3Dimages of the human body. In 1976, endoscope probes were developed which meant doctors could look inside human bodies. In 1987, MRI scanning was developed, this gave doctors a scan of a human body using magnets. </p>
        <p>In the 1950s, Peter Medawar developed anti-histamine, which helps prevent allergies. In the 1970s, Patrick Steptoe discovered IVF fertility treatment to help pregnancy. In 1978, Louise Brown was the first IVF baby. </p>
        <p>Today, doctors cannot cure all infections and diseases. Viral infections like AIDS and some types of cancer cannot be completely cured. </p>
        <p>After blood groups were discovered in 1901, blood tests began to increase in popularity. Doctors today can use blood tests to examine a patient's level of cholesterol, a patient's DNA and some indicators of their risk of developing cancer. Rontgen discovered X-rays in 1895. This allowed us to scan bones.</p>
        <p>Doctors and patients can now monitor their blood pressure, heart rate and lots of other things. People suffering from diabetes need to measure their blood sugar levels to keep it at the right levels. Wearable technology lke the Fitbit and Apple Watch help people to monitor their own health. </p>
        <p>People knew that antibodies attacked different types of microbes. Because of this, they were called magic bullets. Paul Ehrlick decided to create magic bullets that behaved like antibodies using chemicals. Ehrlich argued that if certain dyes could stain bacteria, certain chemicals could also kill bacteria. Ehrlich found a dye that killed malaria germs and he tried hundreds of compounds to kill the bacteria behind syphilis. He thought he had failed to find a dye to kill syphilis bacteria, but the 606th compound tried - Salvarsan 606 - worked. This was the start of the modern pharmaceutical industry. </p>
        <p>The second magic bullet (prontosil) found by Gerhard Domagk (worked for Bayer) in 1932. Prontosil is a red dye that contained sulphonamide. This killed the streptococcus microbe, but it also had bad side-effects and could damage the kidneys and liver. </p>
        <p>If antibiotics were used too much and not all bacteria dies when antibiotics were taken, then bacteria can evolve and become resistant. If antibiotics stop killing bacteria then surgery and infections would be more similar to the Middle Ages. </p>
        <p>The first bacteria called methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), appeared in 1961. MRSA infections have been reduced after the NHS encouraged medical staff to wash their hands continuously throughout the day. Tis is consistent with Pasteur's Germ Theory and Aseptic surgical methods. Things like disposable surgical gloves are useful for this. </p>
        <p>Alternative treatments today generally use natural herbs/plants or theories about the body to relieve pain and illness. Some of these treatments are more accepted and are available on the NHS. For example, acupunture and homeopathy. </p>
        <p>In 1952, surgeons successfully performed an organ transplant. The first organ transplant in Britain was in 1960. In 1967, a South African surgeon called Christian Barnard successfully performed a heart transplant for the first time (but the patient only lived two and a half weeks). The first heart transplant in Britain was in 1968. In 1986, a British woman called Davina Thompson becomes the first patient to successfully receive a heart, lung and liver transplant. Transplanted organs were often "rejected" by the body because the body's immune system recognised that the body parts were not from that person. Immunosuppressant drugs can stop the body from rejecting the transplanted organs. In 1970, a British scientist called Roy Caine developed a drug which stopped the body rejecting transplanted organs called cyclosporine. In 2006, the first partial face transplant was successful. In 2008, the first full face transplant was successfully performed. </p>
        <p>Henri Becquerel and Marie Curie discovered radiation in 1898. Since then, radiotherapy has been used to kill cancer cells. Radiotherapy targets cancer cells using gamma rays and X-rays. In World War Two, doctors found that some drugs could treat cancer. This is called chemotherapy. Some drugs like folic acid can stop cancer cells from growing. The latest treatments of cancer are called immuno-oncology. They involve using the body's immune system to attack cancer cells. White blood cells called T cells can target and kill the cancer cells. </p>
        <p>Anaethetics were developed which enabled patients to remain unconscious for longer. This meant doctors could try more complicated procedures. In 1950, William Bigelow performed the first open-heart surgery. Anaesthetics made more complex surgery like this possible. In 1958, a pacemaker was fitted in the heart. Keyhole surgery was created. This means the surgeon could perform an operation through small incisions. Keyhole surgery needed improvemens in video so tat tiny cameras could be put into the body to do surgery. Using miniature instruments and fibre-optic cameras, surgeons can perform operations which reconnected nerves and blood vessels together. Laser surgery was first used in 1987 in eye surgery. Alongside eye surgery, lasers can also help treat skin conditions, remove ulcers, control bleeding, and help remove blockages in arteries. A prosthetic limb is an artificial body part that can replace arms or legs. Pare had designed some prosthetic limbs but investments after the world wars improved the technology. In 1972, John Charnley made the first hip replacements and in 1984, skin grafts became widely available. In the 1900s, prosthetic limbs with microprocessors were released. Some surgeons now do robot assisted surgery. The robot is controlled by the surgeon. This became more common after 2000. Robot assisted surgery can make smaller cuts than surgery done by humans. This reduces the size of scars and the chance of infection. </p>
        <br>
        <h2><u>Prevention of Illness</u></h2>
        <p>There has been a trend towards 'positive health'. This means that people focus on the prevention of disease and illness rather than curing it. People are now more concerned with a healthy diet and regular exercise. This has been accompanies by a rise in screening, which checks people to make sure they are healthy and catches early signs of disease. </p>
        <p>Vaccination campaigns and lifestyle campaigns have both been used in the 20th century to stop people from getting diseases or illnesses in the first place. </p>
        <p>If a high percentage of the population is vaccinated against a disease, then the spread of contagious disease is a lot slower. Vaccination is still very effective, even if not everyone is vaccinated. Vaccination campaigns can get enough people vaccinated for there to be herd immunity. </p>
        <p>The diptheria vaccine was introduced in 1942. Before then it killed around 3,500 children each year. Diptheria was a bacterial disease that could cause heart failure ad paralysis. People feared that wartime conditions would make diptheria more common, so the government introduced and advertised the vaccination. </p>
        <p>Polio is caused by a virus and can cause paralysis. It attacks the body's nervous system and blood. Polio caused up to 750 deaths and thousands of disabilities each year. The polio vaccine was introduced in 1956 and a campaign to vaccinate everyone under 40 was launched. By 1980, polio had been almost eradicated in Britain. </p>
        <p>The government tried to improve people's health choices in the second half of the 20th century. The Change4Life campaign was launched in 2009. It tried to improve people's diet and encourage exercise. Obesity has risen government's 2004 Drinkaware campaign aims to reduce drinking. These interventions are very different to the laissez-faire policies of UK governments 100-300 years ago. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>The NHS</h2>
        <p id = "starter">The National Health Service (NHS) was set up by Aneurin Bevan in 1948. People had received free healthcare during the war and people wanted the service to continue.</p>
        <p>After the World Wars, inequality in the postwar world was realised, leading to many later reforms. When children were evacuated to the countryside, more people realised the differences in living standards between people in different areas, some children were in a very unhealthy state after living in these areas. The need to raise large armies made the government aware of the problems created for society by an unhealthy workforce. In 1918, it became compulsory for local counsils to provide healthy visits and support for pregnant women and in 1919, councils started to build housing for poor families and a Ministry for Health was set up, looking after sanitation, healthcare and the training of doctors and nurses. In 1834, the Free School Milk Act meant children could have free milk in schools, critical as Britain was hit by the Great Depression. The New Towns Act (1946) was set up to plan new towns, the Clean Air Act (1956) established smokeless zones in cities, the Black Report (1980) said that there were still inequalities in health between the rich and poor. </p>
        <h3>Opposition to the NHS</h3>
        <p>There was not unanimous support for the NHS as doctors did not want to be employed by the government. This public good meant doctors could lose some of their income. Bevan promised to pay doctors a salary and allowed them to continue working privately as well. Also, lots of Conservatives dislike the NHS, but it was too popular to abolish.</p>
        <h3>Cost of the NHS</h3>
        <p>The cost of the NHS has increased dramatically in the last 70 years. The original plan was to pay for the NHS through National Insurance contributions, but this only covered 10% of costs. In 1948, the NHS budget was estimated to be £15 billion. In 2015/2016, the NHS budget was estimated to be £116.4 billion.</p>
        <h3>Success of the NHS</h3>
        <p>The NHS has been relatively successful. Child mortality rates have fallen (and maternity services are likely to have helped this). New and improved hospitals have better facilities. Vaccinations provided under the NHS have got rid of diseases like tuberculosis. Healthcare and affordabiltiy of treatment is a lot better in Britain relative to the United States.</p>
        <h3>Choices of the NHS</h3>
        <p>Today, drugs are very expensive. Medicine lets people live longer, but older people on average need the NHS more. This increases the cost of the NHS. The question today is, who should pay for which treatments and how can enough money be raised to pay for all the treatments needed? To deal with these questions, the National Insurance for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have a metric called a Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) valuing a life at £30,000 per year. This metric helps to compare where money should be spent.</p>
        <p>Preventative health care is often cheaper than medical treatments. Campaigns encouraging healthy eating and discouraging smoking and drinking have been introduced, as well as the Smoking Ban (2007) which banned smoking in public areas and building as well as in cars. </p>
        <br>
        <h2><u>Case Study - Penicilin</u></h2>
        <p>Alexander Fleming worked in an army hospital in World War One. He saw lots of soldiers die after their wounds became infected with the Staphylococcus bacteria. </p>
        <h3>Discovery</h3>
        <p>Fleming found that lysozyme, an enzyme in tears killed some bacteria. Later on, he accidentally left out some staphylococcus bacteria in his lab. When he returned, he found that one of the plates had grown mould which stopped the bacteria from growing. This mould then became penicilin. Florey and Chain read Fleming's article and then began experiments on mice, later moving to human testing. It worked but doctors had not produced much of it. </p>
        <h3>Production</h3>
        <p>The scientists had to find a way to mass produce the penicilin. In 1939, the British government would not fund the project as they were too focuses on the war and the chemical companies which were producing explosives. However, during the Second World War, lots of soldiers got infected wounds so the USA stepped in and funded mass production of penicilin in 1943. In 1945, Margaret Hutchinson Rousseau developed the technology to produce penicilin on a large scale. It is estimated that 15% of injured US and British soldiers would have died if they did not have penicilin. After the war, chemical companies began selling penicilin to the general public as an antibiotic and the cost fell as more was produced.</p>
        <br>
        <h2><u>Case Study - Lung Cancer</u></h2>
        <p id = "starter">Lung disease became a lot more common in the 20th century.</p>
        <p>36,000 people in the UK die from lung cnacer each year. Scientists think that 89% of lung cancer cases are "preventable" and these are usually linked to smoking tobacco, as smoking became very popular in the First World War.</p>
        <h3>Scientific Advances</h3>
        <p>Doll and Hill found a link between smoking tobacco and cases on lung cancer in 1950. Scientific reasearch helped to find this link. X-rays and Ct scans can create images of people's lungs to help diagnose cancer. Modern cancer treatments like chemotherapy and radiotherapy can treat lung cancer, as well as surgery.</p>
        <h3>Prevention</h3>
        <p>The Royal College of Physicians recommended stopping tobacco companies from advertising in 1963. TV adverts were banned in the UK in 1965. Health warnings were put on cigarette packets in 1971 and, in England, smoking in public places was banned in 2007.</p>
        <h3>Attitudes in Society</h3>
        <p>19% of men and 15% of women still smoked in 2019, despite these campaigns ad scientific advances. Although smoking is less common, attitudes in society have not shifted completely. This may be because of complex social factors, as well as the addictive nature of cigarettes</p>
